# Boise Codeworks: Inspire Page

This project was a required checkpoint. The challenge was to request different forms of data from multiple API's, including posting and deleting data. This included a weather API, quote and author API, a random image API, and a to do list API.

I took an extra step to incorporate a "backup" protocol: If the API fails, dig into localStorage to get the last saved form of data received from the API; if the localStorage fails, set the data to a random piece of data in a preset array.
